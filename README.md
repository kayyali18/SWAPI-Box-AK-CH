# Swapi-Box
## Intro
For this project, we continue to develop muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

For this project, we will be hitting The Star Wars API to tap into a “black hole” of Star Wars data.

## Project Goals & Requirements:
- Learn how to wireframe and know why it is important.
- Get comfortable whipping together React components on your own with the additional complexity of implementing React Router.
- Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 & ES7 syntax.
- Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
- Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
- Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
- Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.
- Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
